Changes since Gridsphere 1.1.1
==============================

+ Implementation of JSR 168 portlet API that is 100% sun tck compliant. The 
 model uses existing gridsphere portlet called PortletServlet as a controller
 for JSR 168 portlets. Both portlet apis are still being supported. The 
 underlying impl code is portlet/impl for gridsphere and portlet/jsrimpl for 
 JSR implementation. 
+ Added checkXXXRole methods to ActionPortlet to allow action methods to do
 role checking to avoid security vulnerabilities with file manager and banner 
 portlet
+ Improved tags overall and enhanced table tag to be sortable and break 
  into pages of data
+ ActionPortlet model for JSR portlets
+ Updated templating build system to develop JSR portlets
+ Added create TCK user/layout code to GS portal and layout engine to 
 run thru compliance tests. Ant target/task deploytck creates gs style portlet WAR's out of existing TCK WAR files.
