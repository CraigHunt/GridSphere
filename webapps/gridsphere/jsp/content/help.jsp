<h2>Help for Content Management</h2>

Use the editor to create new/edit/delete documents. If you want to link to another page within your GridSphere
installation
you can use the following syntax:

<pre>
    [[This is my link|id]
</pre>

This will render a link named 'This is my link' to the fragment with the id 'id'. This can be a tab or a portlet. The id
is defined in the Layout administration.
