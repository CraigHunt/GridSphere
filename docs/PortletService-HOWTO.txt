Developing a new Portlet Service


1. The Portlet Service Framework

Portlet services allow for the easy separation of a service used to perform
a set of operations from the portlets and the portlet container that use them.

A portlet service is instantiated by a portlet service factory.
The factory is responsible for the lifecycle management of
portlet services. The factory has its own init() and destroy() methods
that get invoked by the portlet container to startup and shutdown all
portlet services.

The PortletServiceFactory defines the following method:

PortletService createPortletService(Class service,
                                    Properties serviceProperties,
                                    ServletConfig servletConfig,
                                    boolean useCachedService)
throws PortletServiceUnavailableException, PortletServiceNotFoundException;

The client is expected to provide the following data:
service -- the interface defining the service to be instantiated
serviceProperties -- defines the properties file containing mappings between
                     service interfaces and the implementing classes
servletConfig -- the ServletConfig object of the portlet conatiner
usCachedService -- indicates to the factory of a new instance of the service
                    should be created or reused if one currently exists

The properties file, located in GridSphere under
webapps/WEB-INF/conf/PortletServices.properties has entries like the following:

># User Manager Service
>org.gridlab.gridsphere.services.UserManagerService
>                 = org.gridlab.gridsphere.services.impl.UserManagerServiceImpl

This simply maps the interface of the service to its concrete implementation.
In this way, new implementations for a given interface may be easily swapped
in or out.

Portlet services may be obtained in two ways:

1) If the client is the portlet container
or another portlet service an instance of the portlet service factory can be
obtained via the implementing SportletServiceFactory class as shown:

PortletServiceFactory factory = SportletServiceFactory.getInstance();
PortletService coolService = factory.createService();

2) If the client is another portlet using the service, it can obtain a portlet
service via the PortletContext as shown:

portletService coolService
                    = getConfig().getContext().getService(CoolService.class);

In the second case, the portlet context hides the factory from the client and
uses the default factory settings.


2. A Portlet Service Example

Suppose you want to create the CoolService. Here are the steps to follow:

A) Create a new Service interface that extends PortletService:

 public interface CoolService extends PortletService {

     public void doSomethingCool();

 }

B) Create an implementing class CoolServiceImpl that also implements the
PortletServiceProvider interface. The PortletServiceProvider defines
an interface consisting of init() and destroy() methods for handling
the Portlet Service lifecycle. Upon instantiation by the PortletServiceFactory,
the init(PortletServiceConfig config) method of the portlet service is
invoked. The PortletServiceConfig defines methods for retrieving information
from the PortletServices.properties and the servlet.xml information. These two
files can be potentially used for portlet service startup values rather than
hardcoding them directly into the init() method. The example CoolServiceImpl
is shown below:


 public class CoolServiceImpl implements PortletServiceProvider, CoolService {

    public void init(PortletServiceConfig config)
                    throws PortletServiceUnavailableException {
        // Place optional startup routines e.g. loading data from database
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // Place optional shutdown routines here e.g. saving data to database
    }

    public void doSomethingCool {
        System.err.println("I'm doing something cool!");
    }

 }

C) Add an entry to the PortletServices.properties file:

># Cool Service
>org.myproject.services.CoolService
>    = org.myproject.services.impl.CoolServiceImpl


D) (Optional) Invoke service from portlet container or portlet as explained in (1)


E) TODO: Create a test harness to insure proper operation of service.
