    <para>

    </para>


    needs to go somewhere else:

    <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>viewmode - standard more is also shown if nothing is specified </para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>editmode - if enabled, this mode is intended for the user to specific settings for themself</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>configuremode - if enabled, the configuremode is intended to allows admins to specify settings for a portlet for all users</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>helpmode - if enabled, this should show helpinformation</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
        Short example on the usage of the viewmodes:
        So if you would have a stockquote porlet, the user would see the stockquote information in view mode, in editmode
        the user could select which stockquotes he wants to see and the admin can use the configuremode to select the stockquote
        service to get the information from.
    </para>
    For each of these modes exists a doView, doEdit, doHelp and doConfigure method. For now we just implement
    the doView mode to show some text in a portlet. In Line 7 we get a writer and in Line 8 it just puts out text (which
    is in this case an html statement).
