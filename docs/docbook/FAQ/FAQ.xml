                    I'm using JDK 1.4.1 and when the build script tries to build the docbook target it fails with:
<literallayout>[style] : Fatal Error! org.apache.xml.dtm.DTMException:
No more DTM IDs are available Cause: org.apache.xml.dtm.DTMException:
No more DTM IDs are available</literallayout>
                    </para>

For some reason the version of Xalan shipped with JDK1.4.1 has some bugs.
The recommended solution is to copy xalan.jar from <filename>lib/ext</filename> in the GridSphere source to
<filename>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/endorsed</filename>.

                    Why is it called GridSphere-- I don't see anything Grid related in it!

                In our first release of GridSphere we have developed a portal framework based upon the portlet
                API. To provide greater reusability and flexibility, it was decided to not require any Grid
                services for the proper functioning of the GridSphere portlet container. However, we are currently
                developing many fundamental Grid portlets that will showcase GridLab and OGSA services.
