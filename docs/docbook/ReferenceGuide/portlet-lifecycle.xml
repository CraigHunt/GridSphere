The following lifecycle methods are implemented or subclassed by the Portlet classes:

void destroy() -- an application portlet is taken out of service

void service(PortletRequest req, PortletResponse res) -- service gets invoked for every client request, based on the
                                                         portlet mode or portlet action, it invokes the appropriate
                                                         actionPerformed, doView, doEdit, etc, method.

void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) -- this method is invoked when the portlet receives an action and must be
                                         implemented by the portlet developer. This method is performed before any
                                         rendering is done via doView, doEdit, etc.

void do{View,Config,Edit,Help,Title}(PortletRequest req, PortletResponse res) -- renders the portlet  mode and is
                                                                                 generally implemented by the portlet
                                                                                 developer.

void window{Maximized,Minimized,Closed,Resizing,...}(WindowEvent event) -- method is invoked when the portlet window
                                                                           state changes.
