    The GridSphere UI tag and visual bean library makes it easier to develop portlets using the
    GridSphere Action portlet provider model described in the Tutorial.
    The UI tag library is used to construct interfaces as visual components that wrap underlying
    HTML elements with a default look and feel. The visual beans provide bean representations of the tags
    to be used in portlets for action handling or presentation logic. This reference guide is intended to
    summarize UI tag and bean usage.
