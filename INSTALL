	Building the GridSphere Distribution
=======================================================


Requirements
------------
0)    Building the GridSphere distribution requires Ant available at 
http://jakarta.apache.org/ant. In addition, make sure the $ANT_HOME/lib directory contains junit.jar used for testing
and xalan.jar used to construct the documentation from the XSL style sheets. Both junit.jar and xalan.jar are found in
the lib directory.

1) You will also need a Tomcat 4.1+ servlet container available at http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat. In addition to
providing a hosting environment for GridSphere, Tomcat provides some of the required XML Jars that are needed for
compilation.

2) (Optional) If you wish to build PDF formats of the documentation download a FOP binary from
http://xml.apache.org/fop/download.html and unpack it and set FOP_HOME to the top level FOP
directory (just like ANT).

Compiling and Deploying
-----------------------

    The Ant build script, build.xml, uses the build.properties file to specify any compilation options. Edit
    build.properties appropriately for your needs.

At this point, simply invoking "ant dist" will create the GridSphere distribution.  

The build.xml supports the following basic tasks:

clean -- removes the build and dist directories including all the 
	 compiled classes

update -- updates the existing source code from CVS

compile-all -- compiles all the GridSphere source code including 
	       the core framework and all the portlets

dist -- creates a GridSphere distribution in the dist directory 
	defined in build.properties

deploy -- deploys the GridSphere framework and all portlets to a 
	  Tomcat servlet container located at $CATALINA_HOME

docs-all -- compiles all GridSphere docbook documentation and 
	    builds the Javadoc documentation from the source code

make-test-reports -- runs all Junit tests and creates HTML
		     status reports in the build/reports directory 

To see all the targets invoke "ant --projecthelp".

2) Read the documentation in the docs/ directory found in the build or dist directory for more information on using and developing portlets with GridSphere.
