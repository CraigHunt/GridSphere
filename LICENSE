 The GridSphere Project's Commitment to Open Source

All software developed by the GridSphere Project is made available under a liberal
open source license.  This license allows the software to be used by anyone and
for any purpose, without restriction. We are committed to maintaining the same
open source distribution policy into the future.   We believe that this is the
best way to ensure that Grid technologies gain wide acceptance and benefit from
a large developer community.
